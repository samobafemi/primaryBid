Observations around the user experience(UX).

During the sign up process the user should be informed that the email is not valid when it's being typed into the email text field. Allowing the user to complete filling the form, submit it and then show the error message have a negative impact on the performance. The same scenario occured when the passwords entered were not matching.

When a user logged in, no information on the user that logged in on the navigational bar. it only show Profile.

Using an arrow to scroll at the right/left end of the scrolling image on the "about us page" section "how it works" would improve the user experience compare to clicking the tiny page icon below the scrolling images.
